Exercise 4
The arithmetic sequence is given with the following formula:
an = 10 + 4n
Calculate the sum of the first ten elements of this sequence. 
Print the result to the console as shown below.
Expected result:
The sum of the first 10 elements in a sequence: 320.0
'''
n = 10
a1 = 14
a10 = 50
sum = n/2 * (a1 + a10)
print(f'The sum of the first {n} elements in a sequence: {sum:.1f}')
